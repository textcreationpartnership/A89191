            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Yeſterday before the break of day, a party of the Enemy out of <hi>Denbigh</hi> Caſtle, being about ſixſcore, and thirty mounted fire-locks, fell upon Captain <hi>Richard Price</hi> his Quarters, within two miles of this Town; but he was vigilant, and his Scouts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their duty ſo well, that they were drawn into the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:159647:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 89 -->field before they came upon them, which gave him oppertunity to avoid them, and convey the Alarum to this Town; And thereupon Colonel <hi>Carter</hi> with a ſtanding Horſe-guard, which we are fain to keep in the field conſtantly to ſecure our Out quarters; and Captain <hi>Simkies</hi> with my own Troop, which was then upon the Guard in this Town, drew out and fell between them and <hi>Denbigh,</hi> and within half a mile of their Garriſon met with them, and charged them ſo gallantly, that they broke in upon them, killed ſeven of them (as is ſaid) upon the place; and in the purſuit, took four Captains, one Lieutenant, two Cornets, divers Troopers, and about fourty Horſe, with the loſſe of one man of our ſide. The Siege at <hi>Hoult</hi> hath of late been of great difficulty and hazard to thoſe few men I have there: For the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off of the Cheſhire Fire-locks from that Service, without any privity, gave the Enemy an advantage to burn the Guard the Firelocks kept (which coſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey much to fortifie) and above fourty dwelling Houſes more in the Town, and expoſed my men (who lay in open Quarters, and were fewer in number then the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my within were) to their power, which neceſſitated my men to be upon continual duty. Upon the firſt of <hi>April</hi> the Enemy ſallied out and fell upon Major <hi>Sadlers</hi> Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, reſolving to put all my men in that Houſe to the Sword, which they had been like to effect, had not a Guard which was placed in a Mount, erected by us three dayes before relieved them: In this ſtorm I loſt five men, and fourteen wounded; of the Enemy there were killed their Commander Captain <hi>Cottingham</hi> a Papiſt, a Lieutenant, and two more, and many wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: There hath been never a day ſince, but they ſallied out conſtantly twice or thrice a day, and as conſtantly

And further, that they will be pleaſed to appoint a Governor for this Caſtle, Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Thomas Maſon,</hi> is a very faithful active and godly Gentleman, and the moſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man in his profeſsion that we have in theſe parts, having been a Souldier above twenty yeers, and loſt his command in <hi>Ireland,</hi> becauſe he refuſed to bear Arms againſt the Parliament: And if this place were worthy of him, I ſhould make bold to recommend him to their conſideration.
